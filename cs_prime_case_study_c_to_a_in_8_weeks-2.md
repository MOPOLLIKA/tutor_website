# C->A in 8 weeks

**From 55% to 78%. Dream uni back in play.**

In April 2025, a Year 13 student and her parents came to us worried and unsure what to do. Spring mocks said **C**. The offer letter said **A**. They had tried other tutors. Nothing worked. They decided to join **CS Prime Academy**.

The first sessions were heavy. Concepts felt slippery and exam timing was brutal. We began with a diagnostic to map strengths, gaps, and speed bottlenecks. Then we slowed the pace and rebuilt method by method: understanding first, execution second.

We established close communication with the student and her parents to support progress at every step. That included:

- offering bespoke home practice sets targeting her specific problems,

&#x20;

- providing extra support between lessons when homework became challenging,

- applying exam techniques used by top 1% students drilled into muscle memory,

- maintaining parent communication with **under 15‑minute** DM response time, Monday to Sunday.

These are standard CS Prime practices applied to every student, not experimental methods. And these are only a few examples of the full range of support and systems we offer.

After three weeks, the results started to show: **+10%** on the average score. Confidence followed. Answers became structured, timing steadier, corrections rarer.

We pushed into full papers, mixed‑topic rotations, and calm repeatability. By week eight, timed scripts held at **78%**. June arrived. A‑levels finished. The **C** became a **strong A**.

Parents had clarity. She had control. The dream university was back within reach.
